# Project_HR_Analytics
In this project, our focus is on analyzing employee attrition, environmental satisfaction, and performance ratings. We aim to evaluate these datasets to gain insights into how to increase employee satisfaction, improve the work culture, enhance benefits, and upgrade communication among coworkers. This will help us foster better relationships among colleagues, both internally and externally, as we believe that company is not just a place for professional growth but also a community that connects friendship with a team and our clients.
